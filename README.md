# MedievalDynasty-RestoreCheatMenu
 DLL to restore the ingame cheat menu.


Steam will want xinput1_3.dll, MS Store version will want xinput1_4.dll.

When launching the game with the DLL in place a black console window should appear.  If you do not see this window, the game likely failed to find the DLL.

For the MS Store version, drop xinput1_4.dll in the folder:
	C:\XboxGames\Medieval Dynasty\Content

For the Steam version, drop xinput1_3.dll in the folder:
	....Wherever Steam wants it.  Let me know where works and I'll update this.
